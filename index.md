## About Kristina Lerman
I am a Principal Scientist at USC Information Sciences Institute and holds a joint appointment as a Research Associate Professor in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering's Computer Science Department. My research focuses on applying network- and machine learning-based methods to problems in social computing.

## Research Interests
**Social Networks:** complex systems and social computing, mathematical analysis of multi-agent systems.	 

**Data Science:** computational social science, computational cognitive science, bias in data and algorithms.	 

**Artificial Intelligence:** machine learning, fairness, transparency and accountabilty.
